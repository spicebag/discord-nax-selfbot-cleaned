# discord-nax-selfbot-cleaned
A cleaned version of the Nax Selfbot. Token Logger has been removed and code has been optimised.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q : Can I get banned for this?
A : Just be cautious with using it and you won't be.

Q : The Selfbot just closes when I open it, how do I fix it?
A : Either re-run the setup.exe or open the prompt using the cmd "Python" command. And contact me with the error and i'll help fix it.

Q : Did you originally create this?
A : No. The original creator of this selfbot token-logged anyone who used it and once I found out I removed the token logger and made the code open-source.

Q : Can I edit the bot code?
A : I'd prefer not, but if you really want to just be sure to credit me, or the original creator (Nox.)

Q : Can I sell the selfbot?
A : No.

Credit to Nox for being the original creator of the Selfbot. Would have been nice if you didn't token log though.
